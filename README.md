# SVG-Logo-Maker

## About this project

This project is done as the seventh assignment of the UC Berkeley full stuck web development coding bootcamp.

I developed this command line application from scratch to meet the following requirements;

- Command-line application that accepts user input
- Enter up to three characters
- Prompted for the text color
- Enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- Presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
- Enter a shape color as a keyword or a hexadecimal number
- generate an SVG file named `logo.svg`
-  "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
- `logo.svg` file in a brower, it;s a 300x200 pixel image that matches the entered criteria

## Installation and usage

1. Download all the files in this reposotory
2. Open the terminal, move to the directory the downloaded files are stored
3. Install npm package inquire package
4. Type node index.js in Terminal and answer all the prompted questions.
5. Once you answer all the questions, the generated SVG file is available in the examples folder.

## Things I leartn in this challenge

- Getting used to how to write unit tests with jest
- How to export and import multiple classes across files
- How to generate a SVG file - it's configured in a way quite similar to HTML files
- Creating a class with class constructor method that doesn't contain any propaties but only contains methods (not using `constructor`)
- Using a callback function to write a unite test for something that throws an error by executing
